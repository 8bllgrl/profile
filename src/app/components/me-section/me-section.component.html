      Hello! My name is Sage and I started my coding 
      journey in the mid-2010s, which when my interest in programming started.
      I would spend hours tinkering with HTML & CSS with 
      <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-girl-learn-code">Tumblr</a>,
       to modding the Sims 4, 
      and hacking my Nintendo 3DS.
      Late nights spent tweaking mods to see the exact content I wished for 
      sparked a drive in me to learn more.

      Now, in the present day, after taking a course at Kenzie Academy to 
      learn Java and employing REST APIs,
      I realized that I wanted to dedicate my life to software engineering.
      I have completed 
      <a href="https://github.com/8bllgrl">several projects</a> 
       and am eager to continue learning and creating
      solutions that benefit others and build my portfolio. I am hard at work, and
      enthusiastic about acquiring new skills. Lately, I've been picking up 
      both Angular & React and brushing up on my HTML & CSS.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      My ultimate goal is to break into the tech industry,
      where I can utilize my skills to their fullest potential.
      I am driven by the same determination I had during my school days,
      where I spent long nights working on projects. As I work on projects,
      I'm eagerly looking forward to employment as a software engineer.
